Hi, this is my Glaze WM configs, the configs don't are so different of the default ones,
but i just added some keybinds like alt+z to notepad++, alt+x to vscode and alt+c to dev-c++.
and reduced the gaps of the windows,and added some trans√°rency in the main window.
in the future i'll make more customizations, but i downloaded this app today and i don't
know so much of this app.
enjoy :)
